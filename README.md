This is yet another repo with the aim of documenting the famous "Hello, world :)" in as many programming languages.
However, this is a little more personal to me. I want to be able to write the programs off my head. I aim to learn,
understand (in first principle) different syntax and ultimately remember.

The files, named as `hello_language.ext`, have comments on when the language was first written/used, the author,
and a historical fun fact (if available).

ps. I am learning a little more computational and programming theory.
