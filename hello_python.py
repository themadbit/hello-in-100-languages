author: Guido van Rossum
history & fun fact: First appeared in 1991.
    Created by Van Rossum --who is no longer the BDFL, Python has been consitently ranked in the top ten most popular
    programming languages since 2003.
    The language derives its name not from the snake but from the British comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus.
